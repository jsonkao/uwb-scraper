# UWB Scraper

Scraping and analyzing the UWB course directory. Note that course data on UWB is updated only when a professor or school updates it.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:spec-journalism/uwb-scraper.git`
2. Open `r.Rproj` in the `r` directory in RStudio. Make a new R markdown file for your analysis. The courses data for Fall 2019 is in the `archive-Fall2019` directory.
